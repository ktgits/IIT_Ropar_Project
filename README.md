# Smart Interactive Path Finding Visualizer

This project is an interactive web-based tool to visualize and understand various pathfinding and graph traversal algorithms. It was developed as part of the internship project at IIT Ropar.

üöÄ Features
Visualizes popular algorithms like:

Breadth First Search (BFS)

Depth First Search (DFS)

Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm

A* Search Algorithm

Best First Search

Prim‚Äôs Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)

Grid-based visualization with support for:

Start and end node placement

Obstacle/wall creation

Weighted grids for weighted algorithms

Random maze and obstacle generation

Real-time animations showing node exploration and path discovery.

Reset and clear grid functionality for multiple runs.

Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Visualization: Canvas API

Version Control: Git, GitHub

IDE: Visual Studio Code

üìñ How It Works
Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.

Place start and end nodes on the grid.

Draw walls or generate a random maze.

Run the algorithm to visualize pathfinding step by step.

Reset the grid to try different scenarios.
